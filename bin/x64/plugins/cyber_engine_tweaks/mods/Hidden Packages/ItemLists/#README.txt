- The name displayed in the options screen is the filename here without .list (eg Cyberware.list --> Cyberware (x items))
- One item per line
- If you want to give more than 1, add a comma and the amount at the end (eg Item.money,1000 to give 1000 of Item.money)


You can use # or // for comments, however not at the same line as an item (unlike the .map files)
